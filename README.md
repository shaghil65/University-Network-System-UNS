# University-Network-System-UNS
This is a University Network System (UNS) in which we have 4 departments. Each department have PCs (Labs &amp; Rooms, etc.) and a DHCP server. This DHCP server is allocating dynamic IPs to all the devices of same network. We have designed and worked on General Lab and other things. It has a President room too. We have implemented Routing Information Protocol (RIP) on complete network which finds the best short route to reach the destination whenever packet (Data &amp; IP information) is passed or sent. Network consist of a web servers of each department which can be accessed by any PC. In Domain Name Server (DNS) we assigned domain names to IP addresses to each web server. We have used File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in our network too. Which can be accessed by any PC of this network.
